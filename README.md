###  Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

#### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v16 or later)
* **npm** or **yarn**
* A **MongoDB Atlas** account or a local MongoDB instance.

#### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the backend repository
git clone [Your Backend Repo URL]
cd chat-backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file in the root and add your variables
touch .env
```

Your `.env` file should look like this:
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```bash
# Run the server
npm run dev
```
The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### 2. Frontend (Web) Setup

```bash
# Clone the frontend repository in a separate terminal
git clone [Your Frontend Repo URL]
cd chat-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# IMPORTANT: Update the API URL
# In the React project, find all instances of 'http://localhost:5000'
# and ensure they point to your running backend server.

# Run the React development server
npm start
```
The frontend will open on `http://localhost:3000`.

###  Project Structure

The backend code is organized into a modular structure for better separation of concerns, making it clean and scalable.

* `config/`: Handles the database connection.
* `controllers/`: Contains the business logic for each route.
* `models/`: Defines the Mongoose schemas for Users, Rooms, and Messages.
* `routes/`: Defines the API endpoints (e.g., `/api/auth`, `/api/rooms`).
* `services/`: Encapsulates the Socket.IO real-time logic.
* `server.js`: The main entry point that initializes the app and ties everything together.
